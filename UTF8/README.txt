This US Rom uses Unicode(UTF-8) as font table, so there's no need Shift-JIS-XXX.tbl anymore.

Just run fdtext_utf8.exe to export text, change text, then run udtext_utf8 to import text.

Pics in the folder are my test result.

PS: The only important thing is [MUST OPEN TXT USING UTF-8 FORMAT AND NEVER CHANGE IT TO OTHERS]!
